## Running the module

Please see the [ps2alerts/stack](https://github.com/ps2alerts/stack) repository for information on how to install the dev environment and start this project.

This module uses [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), a JavaScript frontend Framework built on Vue 2, with Typescript support. We use this for various reasons, in particular Server Side Rendering (for SEO) and various other rich plugins.

## TL;DR

When you first clone make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` so you can setup the `ps2alerts-constants` submodule

Run `ps2alerts-website-init` on first run. For any subsequent starts, run `ps2alerts-website-dev`.

# Technologies

The project currently uses the following projects:

- Vue 2 via Nuxt (originally Vue 3 but it's not mature enough yet to use)
- Typescript
- SCSS
